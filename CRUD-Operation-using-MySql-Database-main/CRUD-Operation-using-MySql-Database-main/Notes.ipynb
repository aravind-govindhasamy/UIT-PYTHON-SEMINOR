    "# Product Management System with RESTful API - Seminar Document\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This seminar introduces a simple Product Management System built using a RESTful API. The system allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on product data stored in a MySQL database. The system is accompanied by a web interface to interact with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies Used\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Python)\n",
    "- **Database**: MySQL\n",
    "- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n",
    "- **Communication Protocol**: REST (Representational State Transfer)\n",
    "- **AJAX**: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backend (Flask API)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Server Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask web server is set up to handle HTTP requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, jsonify, request\n",
    "import mysql.connector as sql\n",
    "from flask_cors import CORS\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "CORS(app)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... (Database connection and CRUD operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... (Database connection and CRUD operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Database Connection\n",
    "A MySQL database is used to store product information. The Flask app connects to the database to perform CRUD operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_db_connection():\n",
    "    return sql.connect(host=\"localhost\", user=\"root\", passwd=\"\", database='Products')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. API Endpoints\n",
    "Several API endpoints are defined to handle different operations on the product data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GET all products:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/products', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_all_products():\n",
    "    # ... (Fetch and return all products)\n",
    "GET product by ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/products/<int:product_id>', methods=['GET'])\n",
    "def get_product_by_id(product_id):\n",
    "    # ... (Fetch and return product by ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "POST add product:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/products/add', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def add_product():\n",
    "    # ... (Add a new product)\n",
    "DELETE product by ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/products/delete/<int:product_id>', methods=['DELETE'])\n",
    "def delete_product(product_id):\n",
    "    # ... (Delete product by ID)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PUT update product by ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/products/update/<int:product_id>', methods=['PUT'])\n",
    "def update_product(product_id):\n",
    "    # ... (Update product by ID)\n",
    "4. Exception Handling\n",
    "Exception handling is implemented to provide meaningful error messages in case of issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # ... (Code that might raise an exception)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    return jsonify({'error': str(e)})\n",
    "Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)\n",
    "The frontend is a simple web interface that interacts with the Flask API using JavaScript and AJAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. HTML Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ... (HTML structure for product management form and table) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. CSS Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "/* ... (CSS styling for the form, table, and buttons) */\n",
    "3. JavaScript Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "// ... (JavaScript for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting products using AJAX)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage\n",
    "Start the Flask server: python your_flask_app.py\n",
    "Access the web interface: http://127.0.0.1:5000\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This seminar provides an overview of a simple Product Management System with a RESTful API. The combination of Flask, MySQL, and AJAX allows for efficient handling of product data. The system can be extended and customized based on specific requirements."
